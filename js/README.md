# Intro to Web Development Example Websites

## Info

This is the example webpage written for the Intro to Web Development workshop given at the UTA Central Library on February 21st. If you would like to review the workshop slideshow, you can do so at [this link](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1XdSMZOCv9Tg2q0AUcReGy85siwtMeh9sfbQJCUupxxA).

Feel free to download the files and mess around with them to get a better understanding of front-end web development.

As a reminder: HTML, CSS, and Javascript files can be opened in any plaintext editor or IDE (integrated development environment).

## Basic Setup Instructions

1. Download the zip file from the GitHub page or clone the directory to your local machine.
2. Extract the zip file on your local machine.
3. Open any of the 3 folders.
4. Right-click on index.html, go to 'Open With', and click on your web browser of choice.
